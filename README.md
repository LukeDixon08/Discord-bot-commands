To get the Moderation commands to work you will need a role called "staff" if it is not named exactly that the moderation commands WILL NOT WORK. Give that role to the people you want to have acesse to the ban/mute/unmute/kick/clear commands

MUTE COMMAND
The mute commands needs a role called "mute" for it to work
you need to make it so that role cannot talk in the channels in your server
